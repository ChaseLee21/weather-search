### Challenge Criteria
This challenge is apart of the coding bootcamp. Its purpose is to utilize a server side api and display weather data to the user. For this project I used https://api.openweathermap.org and their free api. The challenge had certain criteria I had to meet:

    -GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
    -WHEN I search for a city
    -THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
    -WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
    -THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
    -WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
    -THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon     representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
    -WHEN I click on a city in the search history
    -THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
